# Web Session Manager

## Introduction

This helps all web SDKs to implement session management.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/torusresearch/session-manager-web.git
cd session-manager-web
npm i
npm run bootstrap
```

### Bundling

Each sub package is distributed in 3 formats

- `esm` build `dist/<MODULE_NAME>.esm.js` in es6 format
- `commonjs` build `dist/<MODULE_NAME>.cjs.js` in es5 format
- `umd` build `dist/<MODULE_NAME>.umd.min.js` in es5 format without polyfilling corejs minified

By default, the appropriate format is used for your specified usecase
You can use a different format (if you know what you're doing) by referencing the correct file

The cjs build is not polyfilled with core-js.
It is upto the user to polyfill based on the browserlist they target

## Build

Ensure you have a `Node.JS` development environment setup:

```
npm run build
```

## Requirements

- This package requires a peer dependency of `@babel/runtime`
- Node 18+
